Solution to the Module 5 "Lab" in the shecodes companion to Bob Tabor's "C# for absolute beginners".

Task: Write a console program that accepts user input, searches a .csv file with flight performance data from 2014 
and presents the user with the results of that search, e.g. average flight delays for flights between New York and Los Angeles.

The task is described in detail on page 15 of the companion here:
https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/CSharpForAbsBeginners.git

Note: My solution only worries about arrival delays (when the plane arrives late at the destination), as those are typically 
the most problematic and can cause you to miss a connecting flight.

I purposefully tried using only tools that have been presented by Bob Tabor to this point Lesson 1-14/Module 5 of the companion, so no lists, only arrays.
