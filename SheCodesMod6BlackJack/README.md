Solution to the Module 6 "Lab" in the shecodes companion to Bob Tabor's "C# for absolute beginners".

Task: Write a simplified BlackJack game. 

The task is described in detail on page 19pp of the companion pdf here: https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/CSharpForAbsBeginners.git

Note: Again, I purposefully tried using only tools that have been presented by Bob Tabor in the lessons covered so far.

Here is a link to the solution by shecodes: https://github.com/dinazil/she-codes-csharp-for-beginners/tree/master/Module6/Blackjack
