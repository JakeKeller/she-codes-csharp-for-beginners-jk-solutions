# she-codes-csharp-for-beginners-jk-solutions
These are my attempts at solving the problems (exercises) from the shecodes companion guide to 
Bob Tabor's "C# For Absolute Beginners" course on MSVA.

I'm trying to complete all exercises without looking at the solutions by shecodes first.
I'm also trying to complete them all using only the tools I've learned progressing through Bob's course thus far.

The idea is to post my solutions here so that other students who are using the companion guide have an additional 
approach to compare their own solutions to. 

Please keep in mind that I am an absolute beginner myself and my solutions are not to be taken as models or examples of good style etc.
They may also contain bugs that I haven't noticed. Feedback is appreciated.

All credit for the companion guide and the exercises I'm trying to solve here obviously goes to
