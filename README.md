# she-codes-csharp-for-beginners-jk-solutions
These are my attempts at solving the problems (exercises) from the shecodes companion guide to 
Bob Tabor's "C# For Absolute Beginners" course on MSVA.

I'm trying to complete all exercises without looking at the solutions by shecodes first. 
The idea is to post my solutions here so that other students who are using the companion guide can compare their own solutions
as there are many possible ways to solve the problems. 

Please keep in mind that I am an absolute beginner myself and my solutions are not to be taken as models or examples of good style etc.
They may also contain bugs that I haven't noticed. Feedback is appreciated.

All credit for the companion guide and the exercises I'm trying to solve here obviously goes to 
https://github.com/dinazil from shecodes.

Here's the link to Bob's fantastic course:
